        <div style="font-size: 20px; padding: 40px; line-height: 1.5;">
            <p>Have you ever wondered who truly knows you the best out of your friends and family? Well, there’s one surefire way to find out: asking them “who knows me better” questions. (You can even make it into a game!) Now you’ll be able to figure out which of your close friends and family members were actually paying attention when you were sounding off about the latest show you streamed on Netflix (“You won’t believe what happened in Season 2 of Bridgerton!”) or were listening attentively as you divulged the embarrassing details of a funny childhood memory.
                So, how do you play? First, you’ll need at least two people (you and another person). Each player should have something to write on (a whiteboard, a sheet of paper, or even their phone’s Notes app) and something to write with (dry erase marker, pencil, or pen). After everyone has an answer sheet, you’ll ask a question, and the players will have 30 seconds each to write down their answer. After 30 seconds, the players will reveal how they answered at the same time; you’ll then share your answer and give a point to whoever answered correctly (you’ll keep track of these points on a score sheet). The person with the most points at the end of the game wins!
